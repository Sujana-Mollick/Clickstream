# Clickstream Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing **clickstream data**, which captures user navigation patterns on a website. The dataset includes information about user sessions, such as the sequence of pages visited and the time spent on each page. The goal is to uncover frequent patterns, user behavior, and insights that can help improve website design and user experience.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following key steps:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand its structure.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform the data for analysis, including calculating average session durations.
3. **Frequent Pattern Mining**: Use algorithms like **Apriori** and **FP-Growth** to identify frequently visited page sequences.
4. **Association Rule Mining**: Generate association rules to understand relationships between different pages.
5. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to analyze page visit frequencies and session durations.

## Datasets

The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file (`Data2.csv`). It contains the following columns:
- `session_id`: Unique identifier for each user session.
- `Sequence`: Comma-separated list of pages visited during the session.
- `SequenceDurations`: Comma-separated list of time durations (in seconds) spent on each page.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `mlxtend`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas mlxtend matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
